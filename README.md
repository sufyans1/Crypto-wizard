# Crypto-wizard

Crypto-Wizard is a cryptocurrency information platform that leverages the CoinGecko API to provide users with real-time data and insights about various cryptocurrencies. This project is developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and the CoinGecko API.

## Features

- **Cryptocurrency List**: Users can view a comprehensive list of cryptocurrencies, including their names, symbols, market caps, prices, and other relevant information.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can easily search for specific cryptocurrencies using the search bar, which filters the list dynamically as they type.
- **Sorting**: The cryptocurrency list can be sorted based on different parameters such as market cap, price, and volume. This allows users to organize the data according to their preferences.
- **Pagination**: To improve usability and performance, the list of cryptocurrencies is divided into pages, with each page displaying a set number of rows. Users can navigate through the pages using the pagination controls.
- **Customizable Rows**: Users have the option to choose the number of rows they want to see per page, allowing them to tailor the display according to their preferences.
- **CoinGecko API Integration**: The platform fetches data from the CoinGecko API to ensure that the cryptocurrency information is up-to-date and accurate.
